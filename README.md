**How it works**

TagTool works by creating categories that are accompanied by Keywords and Blacklist items. When hitting the tag option, it will read all of the text in the Active Column and match it with the keywords. The blacklist items are simply removed from the text before scanning for keywords. 

There is a built in keyword editor where categories can be created, keywords and blacklist items can be modified/added/deleted. Once the keywords are set up, it's as simple as selecting the column and hitting one of the tagging options.

For instructions on using it, please check out the user guide.
